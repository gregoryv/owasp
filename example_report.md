Verify that no more than 100 failed attempts per hour is possible on a single account.
- [ ] **2.2.3** Verify that secure notifications are sent to users after updates to authentication details, such as credential resets, email or address changes, logging in from unknown or risky locations. The use of push notifications - rather than SMS or email - is preferred, but in the absence of push notifications, SMS or email is acceptable as long as no sensitive information is disclosed in the notification.
- [x] **2.3.1** Verify system generated initial passwords or activation codes SHOULD be securely randomly generated, SHOULD be at least 6 characters long, and MAY contain letters and numbers, and expire after a short period of time.

- [x] **5.1.4** Verify that structured data is strongly typed and validated against a defined schema including allowed characters, length and pattern (e.g. credit card numbers or telephone, or validating that two related fields are reasonable, such as checking that suburb and zip/postcode match). ([C5](https://owasp.org/www-project-proactive-controls/#div-numbering))

- [x] **5.3.5** Verify that where parameterized or safer mechanisms are not present, context-specific output encoding is used to protect against injection attacks, such as the use of SQL escaping to protect against SQL injection. ([C3, C4](https://owasp.org/www-project-proactive-controls/#div-numbering))
